# About
### What is farctool2?
farctool2 is a program I wrote for two reasons:
1. To learn how Java can read and manipulate data streams, and
2. Because I already knew the structures of the file formats this game used.

### Why farctool "2"?
farctool2 is the sequel to the original farctool, which was written in Game Maker 8.0.

# Disclaimer
I did not create any of the games in question nor am I affiliated with any of the developers of these video games.
All researched data was acquired via means of downloading game package files through a public database of direct-to-PSN URLs with no protection.
Nothing malicious is intended. This program was written as a labor of love for the franchise and as a budding programmer's first major project.
